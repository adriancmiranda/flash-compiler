# DESCRIPTION:
# 
# fcshctl	(version 0.5.1)
# 
# A Controller for the Flex Compiler Shell (fcsh) that
# runs it in a GNU screen session and allows for sending
# commands to it, just like you would in the interactive
# shell session. Any arguments passed to this script
# are forwarded to fcsh and its output is returned.
# 
# If the first argument is "mxmlc" or "compc" (i.e. if
# you're compiling something), this script will
# automatically check if the same file has been
# compiled before, and if it has, the fcsh "compile"
# command will be used instead with the corresponding
# compile target id (so as to automatically leverage
# fcsh's main feature, incremental compilation).
# 
# 
# (c) 2008 Ali Rantakari (http://hasseg.org)
# 
# ---------------------------------------------------
# REQUIREMENTS:
# 
# The following must be in your $PATH for this script
# to work:
# 
# rm, mv, cat, ps, sleep, tail, head, grep, awk, screen,
# xargs, basename
# 
# You also (obviously) need the fcsh binary, which is
# distributed with the Flex SDK, and can be found
# under /bin there.
# 
# 
# ---------------------------------------------------
# USAGE:
# 
# Set the value of the FLEX_HOME environment variable to
# point to where you have the Flex SDK located and you
# should be good to go -- just call this script with any
# arguments you'd like to send to fcsh as commands, like
# this:
# 
#   $ ./fcshctl help
#   $ ./fcshctl mxmlc -strict=true ./myProject.as
# 
# If you wish to disable the feature of automatically
# invoking the incremental compilation feature based on
# the filename to compile, set the environment variable
# FCSHCTL_AUTO_INCREMENTAL to 1 (false) before calling this
# script:
# 
#   $ export FCSHCTL_AUTO_INCREMENTAL=1
#   $ ./fcshctl mxmlc -strict=true ./myProject.as
