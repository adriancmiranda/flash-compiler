# DESCRIPTION:
# 
# A Proxy script for fcshctl that allows it to
# be used directly in place of mxmlc (i.e. you can
# call this script like you would call mxmlc).
# 
# This version of this script disables the automatic
# incremental compilation feature by setting the
# FCSHCTL_NO_AUTO_INCREMENTAL environment variable
# value to 0.
# 
# This script must be in the same directory as
# fcshctl.
